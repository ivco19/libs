This section contains a step-by-step tutorial with examples for using the **arcovid19** tools.

In part 1 of the tutorial, we explained loading data using arcovid19 and some of the methods 
and attributes inherited from the DataFrame class. Part 2 shows the implementation of the 
*Cases Frame* class methods on the data basis. Lastly, in part 3 of this tutorial, we share the
visualization of the COVID-19 database using the tools provided by the *Plot Cases* class from arcovid19.
